# capstone-buoys
Capstone project for marine science: analyze the National Buoy System

Purpose: Use git and Python before we forget what little we learned.

Goal: Write a python script that automatically fetches historical wind, wave data from ndbc.noaa.gov for all buoys in the Northwest Atlantic (buoy numbers starting with "44...")...and does...something cool with it.

Challenges:
-Fetch data for individual buoy for a single year and find least-square fit between windspeed and wave height (Done -Toby-D)

-Find relationship between windspeed and wave height (as above) for all buoys in "all_buoys.txt" whose numbers start with "44..." (buoys in the northwest Atlantic).

-...
