# capstone-buoys
Capstone project for marine science: analyze the National Buoy System

Purpose: Use git and Python before we forget what little we learned.

Goal: Write a python script that automatically fetches historical wind, wave data from ndbc.noaa.gov for all buoys in the Northwest Atlantic (buoy numbers starting with "44...")...and does...something cool with it.

Challenges:
-Fetch data for individual buoy for a single year and find least-square fit between windspeed and wave height (Done -Toby-D)

-Average 5 years of data for buoy

-Repeat with all buoys starting with "44..." by calling entries in "all_buoys.txt"

-Plot results in spectacular fashion
-...

Guidelines
-Make edits the python notebook, and let the script just be a copy of that.
-Um, that's it :)
