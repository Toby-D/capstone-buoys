# capstone-buoys
Capstone project for marine science: analyze the National Buoy System

Purpose: Use git and Python before we forget what little we learned.

Goal: Write a python script that automatically fetches historical wind, wave data from ndbc.noaa.gov for all buoys in the Northwest Atlantic (buoy numbers starting with "44...")...and does...something cool with it.

Objectives could include:
-Fetch data for individiual buoy for a single year and find least-square fit between windspeed and wave height
-Average 5 years of data for buoy
-Repeat with all buoys starting with "44..."
-Plot results in spectacular fashion
-...
